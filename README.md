# Web Security Telemetry SDK

An open-source client-side JavaScript SDK that collects security telemetry from web applications and provides insights through a backend dashboard. The SDK helps detect bot traffic, anomalous behavior, and other potential security threats.

## 🚀 Features

- **Lightweight JavaScript SDK** – Easily integrate with any web application.
- **Real-Time Telemetry Collection** – Captures browser events, device fingerprints, and performance metrics.
- **Bot & Fraud Detection** – Identifies automated traffic using behavioral analysis.
- **Secure Data Transmission** – Uses encryption (TLS 1.2+) and integrity checks.
- **Privacy-Focused** – No collection of personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.
- **Backend API for Data Processing** – Receives and processes telemetry securely.
- **Admin Dashboard** – Provides insights, visualizations, and alerts.
- **Scalable & Open Source** – Community-driven development with extensible architecture.
- **PCI DSS v4.0 Compliance Features:**
  - **Inventory of all payment page vendor scripts** – Tracks and catalogs all third-party scripts running on payment pages.
  - **Review of business justification and bulk script approval workflows** – Ensures all scripts have a valid business purpose and are approved before deployment.
  - **Identify scripts accessing and extracting data to outside domains** – Detects and logs scripts that send data externally.
  - **Show script change and tamper detection to alert on unauthorized changes** – Monitors script integrity and alerts admins on modifications.
  - **Generate a compliance report as evidence for QSAs** – Provides detailed reports for compliance verification.

## 📦 Installation

### Client-Side SDK
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/security-sdk.js"></script>
<script>
  SecuritySDK.init({
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    endpoint: "https://api.yourserver.com/telemetry",
  });
</script>
```

### Backend Setup (Self-Hosted)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/security-telemetry.git
cd security-telemetry
npm install
npm start
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### Sending Data
```javascript
SecuritySDK.sendEvent({
  type: "click",
  element: "#login-button",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});
```

### Dashboard Access
Once the backend is running, access the admin dashboard at:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Uses **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** to prevent script tampering.
- **CSP-compatible** to work with strict security policies.
- **End-to-end encryption** for telemetry data.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for dashboard users.
